<h3><a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/">The Minnesota State Fair</a></h3>
<p>Labor Day Weekend is the last weekend of the nationally ranked Minnesota
State Fair. If you are interested in prizewinning livestock, deliciously greasy
cheesecurds, or famous Sweet Martha's Cookies, we recommend you take a day to
explore the fair while you're in town.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/">Minnehaha Falls</a></h3>
<p>Minnehaha Falls not only has a lovely waterfall, but is also right next to
the delicious restaurant Sea Salt.</p>
<h3><a href="https://arb.umn.edu/">Minnesota Landscape Arboretum</a></h3>
<p>At the arboretum, you can walk through gorgeous floral gardens and other
natural spaces, or go on the Three-Mile Drive to view various collections and
landscapes. Reservations Required.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/bde_maka_ska_park/">Bde Maka Ska</a></h3>
<p>One of the many lakes in MN with lots of activities. Walking and biking paths
