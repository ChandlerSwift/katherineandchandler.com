<h3>The Minnesota State Fair</h3>
<p>Labor Day Weekend is the last weekend of the nationally ranked Minnesota
State Fair. If you are interested in prizewinning livestock, deliciously greasy
cheesecurds, or famous Sweet Martha's Cookies, we recommend you take a day to
explore the fair while you're in town.</p>
<h3>Minnehaha Falls</h3>
<p>Minnehaha Falls not only has a lovely waterfall, but is also right next to 
    the delicious restaurant Sea Salt.</p>
<h3>Minnesota Landscape Arboretum</h3>
<p>At the arboretum, you can walk through gorgeous floral gardens and other
    natural spaces, or go on the Three-Mile Drive to view various
    collections and landscapes. Reservations Required.</p>
<h3>Bde Maka Ska</h3>
<p>One of the many MN lakes with lots of available activities.</p>
