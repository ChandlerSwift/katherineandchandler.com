<h3>When should I RSVP by?</h3>
<p>Please RSVP via this website by August 6, 2022</p>
<h3>Can I Bring a Guest?</h3>
<p>Everyone invited will be listed on the invitation and on the RSVP 
    website function. If we can accommodate a guest, they will either 
    have their name listed or your invitation will say your name 
    "and Guest".</p>
<h3>What time should I arrive for the ceremony?</h3>
<p>We would love for you to arrive 10-15 minutes early for the 
    ceremony to provide ample time to park and find a seat.</p>
<h3>Is there parking for the ceremony and reception?</h3>
<p>Yes, both the ceremony and reception are at Silverwood Great Hall 
    in St. Anthony and there is ample complimentary parking in their 
    parking lot.</p>
<h3>Are there hotels nearby?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are. If you go to the menu where you found this page, 
    you can navigate to the Travel tab and find hotel information 
    there. We have blocks reserved at three different hotels within 
10 minutes of Silverwood Great Hall where you can reserve rooms for a group 
rate.</p>
<h3>Is the venue accessible?</h3>
<p>Yes, everything in on one level and there are accessible restrooms.</p>
<h3>I have dietary restrictions, what can I eat?</h3>
<p>We are having two entrees served in a buffet: pulled pork and 
    lasagna. The pulled pork is gluten-free, and the lasagna is 
    vegetarian. Beyond that, we will have signs noting what is 
    dietary restriction friendly.</p>
<h3>What is the dress code?</h3> 
<p>We would love to see you in semiformal attire. Not sure what that 
    looks like? Here's a link to some ideas: <a href="https://pin.it/6csBR1N">

<h3>Are either the ceremony or reception going to be held outside?</h3>
<p>Nope! Both the ceremony and reception are being held inside 
    Silverwood Great Hall. The hall does have an outdoor patio that 
    can be utilized during the reception and cocktail hour if you 
    want some fresh air.</p>
